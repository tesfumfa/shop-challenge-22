## User Story
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state<br/>
WHEN I review the appâ€™s store<br/>
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API<br/>
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store<br/>
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider<br/>
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state<br/>
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API<br/>
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store<br/>
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API<br/>
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions<br/>
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API<br/>
